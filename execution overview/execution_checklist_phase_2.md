# Phase 2 Execution Checklist – `P2-OLE`
## Opportunity Library Expansion

This file contains every step required to fulfill and deploy Phase 2. The goal is to populate Notion-ready CSV libraries from Phase 1 assets and build utility scripts for automation, health checks, and data validation.

---

## Overview
Phase 2 transforms raw intelligence into structured Notion libraries: assistants, prompts, shortcuts, tools, and scripts. It also validates relational linking and prepares all data for packaging in Phase 3.

## File Build Checklist

| Task | File | Purpose | Folder | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Define Notion schema | `notion_template_schema.md` | Documents fields for all Notion libraries | `/phase2_libraries/docs/` | [ ] |
| Build Notion sync | `notion_loader.py` | Automates sync of asset data into Notion tables | `/phase2_libraries/scripts/` | [ ] |
| Check for duplicate assistants | `assistant_similarity_checker.py` | Flags near-duplicate names, logic, or metadata | `/phase2_libraries/utilities/` | [ ] |
| Detect stale assets | `library_health_check.py` | Flags entries with no update or linkage | `/phase2_libraries/utilities/` | [ ] |
| Normalize field types | `asset_type_normalizer.py` | Ensures format compatibility before Notion import | `/phase2_libraries/scripts/` | [ ] |
| Sync multi-tag relationships | `multi_tag_sync.py` | Links assets across assistant→prompt→script libraries | `/phase2_libraries/scripts/` | [ ] |

## Phase Gate (PGP-2) Final Pass

| Checkpoint | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| ✅ Structural | All libraries exist as `.csv` with schema-defined fields | [ ] |
| ✅ Functional | All scripts run successfully on sample `.csv` inputs | [ ] |
| ✅ Dependency | Outputs prepare assistants with prompts + scripts for Phase 3 | [ ] |
| ✅ Intentionality | At least 1 assistant fully linked: prompt + shortcut + tool + script | [ ] |

## Notes:
- This phase acts as the “database” layer of your system
- All downstream packaging, logging, and validation assumes clean relational data here
- You may choose to maintain these libraries in Notion or GitHub, or both
