# Phase 4 Execution Checklist – `P4-VVF`
## Visibility + Validation Framework

This file tracks every audit, sync, logging, and validation process required to ensure assistants are functional, trackable, and ready for release or internal use.

---

## Overview
Phase 4 is your QA and visibility layer. Every assistant is validated for completeness and correct execution. Logs are created for tracking usage. Successful builds are pushed to Notion and GitHub with full version metadata.

## File Build Checklist

| Task | File | Purpose | Folder | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Run validation pass | `validator.py` | Verifies manifest has all critical fields and script references | `/phase4_validation/` | [ ] |
| Simulate assistant run | `run_assistant_test.py` | Executes assistant in test mode and tracks result | `/phase4_validation/` | [ ] |
| Log runs | `system_run_log.csv` | Tracks assistant runs across time | `/phase4_validation/logs/` | [ ] |
| Push metadata to Notion | `push_to_notion.sh` | Uploads prompt + assistant status to Notion registry | `/phase4_validation/sync/` | [ ] |
| Push assistant to GitHub | `push_to_github.sh` | Commits + pushes zipped assistant to GitHub repo | `/phase4_validation/sync/` | [ ] |
| Display validation results | `status_dashboard.py` | Streamlit UI to show assistant health and usage history | `/phase4_validation/ui/` | [ ] |
| Sync error logs | `error_log_sync.py` | Collects any assistant run failures | `/phase4_validation/logs/` | [ ] |
| Count usage | `usage_counter.py` | Tracks how many times each assistant has been launched | `/phase4_validation/utilities/` | [ ] |

## Phase Gate (PGP-4) Final Pass

| Checkpoint | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| ✅ Structural | All validators, logs, and dashboards are present | [ ] |
| ✅ Functional | Assistants validated, tested, and launched without error | [ ] |
| ✅ Dependency | Manifest matches Phase 3, and Phase 5 is aware of launch logs | [ ] |
| ✅ Intentionality | At least 1 assistant successfully validated and live on Notion/GitHub | [ ] |

## Notes:
- All deployment paths terminate here
- This is where the system begins to show traceable history, confidence, and measurable use
- You’ll be able to track version launches and sync frequency across your entire assistant stack
