# Phase 3 Execution Checklist – `P3-ESP`
## Execution System Packaging

This file contains all critical build steps required to generate, validate, and package assistant systems as deployable bundles for use in CLI, Streamlit, GitHub, or Notion-triggered pipelines.

---

## Overview
Phase 3 turns structured intelligence into executable systems. Each assistant receives a full folder scaffold with manifest, scripts, logs, prompt files, and shortcut mapping. These folders are then zipped, tagged, and prepared for deployment.

## File Build Checklist

| Task | File | Purpose | Folder | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Package assistant folder | `assistant_packager.py` | Builds assistant folder with `/scripts/`, `/logs/`, and manifest | `/phase3_packages/` | [ ] |
| Write assistant metadata | `manifest_generator.py` | Creates assistant-specific `manifest.json` with ID, version, prompt, script | `/phase3_packages/` | [ ] |
| Create assistant ZIP | `zip_packager.py` | Compresses folder into deployable `.zip` file | `/phase3_packages/` | [ ] |
| Build multi-assistant launcher | `streamlit_assistant_launcher.py` | UI to browse, select, and run assistant flows | `/phase3_packages/ui/` | [ ] |
| Track assistant versions | `version_manifest.json` | Global tracker for all deployed assistant versions | `/phase3_packages/meta/` | [ ] |
| Generate execution log | `run_log.txt` | Tracks assistant runtime logs per folder | `/phase3_packages/logs/` | [ ] |
| Folder validator | `package_validator.py` | Ensures build completeness before zip | `/phase3_packages/utilities/` | [ ] |
| Execution summary | `execution_summary_writer.py` | Generates summary notes post-run for logging/Notion | `/phase3_packages/logs/` | [ ] |

## Phase Gate (PGP-3) Final Pass

| Checkpoint | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| ✅ Structural | Each assistant folder has `/scripts/`, `manifest.json`, and `README.md` | [ ] |
| ✅ Functional | All folders can be zipped and launched via CLI or Streamlit | [ ] |
| ✅ Dependency | Manifest matches required fields from Phase 2 and for Phase 4 audit | [ ] |
| ✅ Intentionality | At least 1 complete assistant fully packaged and tagged | [ ] |

---

## Notes:
- Every assistant packaged here becomes a reproducible unit of execution
- Files must match formatting specs to pass into Phase 4 for validation
- Streamlit UI may also act as a manual review hub for prompts and versions
